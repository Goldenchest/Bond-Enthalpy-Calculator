Bond-Enthalpy-cheatsheet
========================

Bond enthalpy calculator

This is a little program I wrote in 12th grade to help speed up tedious bond enthalpy calculations and reduce human error.
The user simply enters a bond ("H-H", "N--N", etc.), and the program returns the enthalpy value of the bond. One dash represents
a single bond, two dashes represent a double bond, and three dashes represent a triple bond.
